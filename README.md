# 💎 Diamond Price Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on performing **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on a publicly available dataset of diamond characteristics and prices. The primary goal is to uncover the key features that influence a diamond's price and derive actionable business insights through data visualization and statistical exploration.

## 📂 Dataset

The dataset contains various features that describe physical and qualitative attributes of diamonds, including:

- **Numerical Features**: `carat`, `depth`, `table`, `price`, `x`, `y`, `z`
- **Categorical Features**: `cut`, `color`, `clarity`

> 📊 Dataset Source: [Kaggle - Diamonds Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/shivam2503/diamonds)

## 🔍 EDA Process

### 1. **Data Cleaning**
- Checked for null values and data types
- Found the dataset to be clean and well-formatted

### 2. **Univariate Analysis**
- Analyzed the distribution of individual features using histograms and count plots
- Observed that `price` is right-skewed and most diamonds are under 1 carat

### 3. **Outlier Detection**
- Used box plots to identify outliers in `carat`, `price`, and dimensions (`x`, `y`, `z`)
- Flagged extreme values for further attention during analysis (e.g., luxury-priced diamonds)

### 4. **Bivariate & Multivariate Analysis**
- Explored relationships between features and price
- Found that `carat` has a strong positive correlation with `price`
- Used scatter plots, box plots, and bar plots to understand effects of `cut`, `color`, and `clarity`

### 5. **Correlation Matrix**
- Generated a heatmap of numerical features
- Found `carat`, `x`, `y`, `z` to be strongly correlated with price

## 📈 Key Insights

- **Carat** is the most important determinant of price.
- Better **cut** or **color** doesn't always mean a higher price — size plays a dominant role.
- Some large diamonds with lower clarity or color still cost significantly more.
- Outliers (e.g., unusually large diamonds) can skew price analysis and should be treated cautiously.
